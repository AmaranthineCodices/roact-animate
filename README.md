# roact-animate
An animation library for [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/Roact) modeled after React Native's [Animated](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html) library. This is currently a work in progress; the API may change at random!

## Installation
There are two ways to install `roact-animate`. The recommended way is to download the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/AmaranthineCodices/roact-material/releases/latest) and run it from Studio's Run Script option (in the Test tab). Alternatively, you can download the repository's `src` directory manually and get it into Roblox Studio. You can use [Rojo](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo) or a similar plugin for this.

`roact-animate` must be installed in the same location as Roact.

## Usage
Documentation coming soon<sup>tm</sup>. Check the `examples` folder for some examples of how to use this.
